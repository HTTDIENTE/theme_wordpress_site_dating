				Dear God, the Bible says that if I confess with my mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in my heart that You have raised Him from the dead,
				I shall be saved.  Therefore, I confess that Jesus is my Lord.  I make Him Lord of my life right now.  I believe in my heart that You raised Jesus from the dead.
				I renounce my past life with Satan and close the door to any of his devices.  I thank you for forgiving me of all my sins. In Jesus name.  Amen.
